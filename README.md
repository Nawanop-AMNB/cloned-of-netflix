# Cloned of Netflix (Frontend Challenge)

this project is to create a netflix home page with only HTML, CSS and JS only!

there are a few chellanges component especially the infinite scroll carousels.

the purpose of this project is to practice and understand how HTML CSS, JS are working together.

## How to run on local

1. Open project in Visual studio code
2. install `live server` extension
3. At the right-bottom (by default), click at the `Go live`
4. html page should be rendered and enjoy!

## After working hard on this project a while..

I spent time on this project about 20 hours, I finished the home page as I expected (but not already done all). there are things that I get from this project.

1. As I am develop the website with React, so I don't clearly understand how actually HTML, CSS working together with JS. So I have to go deep down html to manage states and styling of components.

2. I just realize how css framworks actually do, there is a custom attribute that have prefix `data-{something}` it a special attribute to create own component system or structure.

3. It open me, that there are a lot of things neeed to know. because my knowledge about HTML, CSS is just a basic compared to the others.

## Conclusion

This challenge project open me how actually HTML, CSS and JS work!. It seems like I have to go deep more to be expert and the journey would be very far from now.
